ToDos & Limitations
====

The initial version of MarkCod is fairly limited, though I have plans to add several things in the future.

* It currently only supports one leve of nesting for documentation pages - This may or may not change depending on demand and how people are using it.

* Unless you are serving your content with CORS headers, JSON and Markdown files must reside on the same domain as the MarkDoc files - This isn't a big deal, because right now MarkDoc doesn't evens upport loading external files.

* There is no syntax highlighting for code. - This is planned as a feature in an upcoming version.

* Support for CSS themes needs to be added.

* Additional CSS rules for prettier formatting need to be added.

* Better error handling for failed JSON requests needs to be added.
